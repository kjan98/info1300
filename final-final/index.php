        <p>The Tompkins County chapter of the Mental Health Association was
          established in 1954, to address mental health needs in the Ithaca
          community. The MHATC’s annual budget is funded by the New York State
          Office of Mental Health (NYS OMH), the New York State Office of People
          With Developmental Disabilities (NYS OPWDD), The United Way, individual
          grants, and private donations. </p>

          <p> The MHATC is committed to developing and supporting the active
            involvement of ordinary people (including providers, family members and
            recipients) in all aspects of mental health; these include the definition
            of needs, the promotion of community and the provision of services. We
            also support the human and civil rights of people who use mental health
            services, and will educate the community on all perspectives concerning
            mental health and mental health disabilities. A <a class = "links" href="https://www.uwtc.org/"

                              mental illnesses to create the Mental Health Bell. </figcaption>

                            <p class = "juan">During the early days of mental health treatment, asylums often
                              restrained people who had mental illnesses with iron chains and shackles
                              around their ankles and wrists. With better understanding and treatments,
                              this cruel practice eventually stopped. </p>
                              <p class = "one"> In the early 1950s, Mental Health America issued a call to asylums
                                across the country for their discarded chains and shackles. On April 13,
                                1956, at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, Md., Mental Health
                                America melted down these inhumane bindings and recast them into a sign
                                of hope: the Mental Health Bell. </p>

                                    a powerful reminder that the invisible chains of misunderstanding and
                                    discrimination continue to bind people with mental illnesses. Today, the
                                    Mental Health Bell rings out hope for improving mental health and
