      young people with emotional, developmental, or behavioral challenges. By providing opportunities
      for support, socialization, and recreation, the program works to keeps youth living happy,
      healthy lives in their homes and communities.
    </p>

    <p>Programs include:</p>

      youth, maintaining at minimum a 1:5 staff-to-youth ratio, and participants have access to a
      variety of activities, including swimming, racquetball, basketball, billiards, and indoor as
