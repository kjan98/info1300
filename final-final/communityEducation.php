<p>MHATC’s Community Education Program works with consumers, family members and the public to
raise awareness and promote understanding of mental health and mental illness. We arrange and/or
provide workshops, forums, presentations, symposia, and opportunities for dialogue in order to
accomplish this end. We also prepare and present information concerning specific topics and areas
of interest as requested by individuals, groups and organizations.
