<h3 class = "subtitle">Peer Services</h3>

<p>Peer support programs provide an opportunity for consumers who have achieved significant
recovery to assist others in their recovery journeys. Peer specialists model recovery, teach
skills and offer supports to help people experiencing mental health challenges lead meaningful
lives in the community. Peer specialists promote recovery; enhance hope and social networking
through role modeling and activation; and supplement existing treatment with education, empowerment,
and aid in system navigation.
</p>

<h3 class = "subtitle">Become a Peer Specialist</h3>

<p>Peer specialists can do nearly everything concerning mental health from administrative tasks
to crisis respite.  Peer specialists can do their work in any number of venues:  hospitals, health
agencies, drop in centers, and free-standing, peer-run agencies.
