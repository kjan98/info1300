Wellness Recovery Action Plan®</a>, or WRAP®, is an evidence-based system that is used world-wide
by people who are dealing with mental health and other kinds of health challenges, and by people who
want to attain the highest possible level of wellness. It was developed by a group of people who
have a lived experience of mental health difficulties; people who were searching for ways to resolve
issues that had been troubling them for a long time. WRAP® involves listing your personal resources,
your Wellness Tools, and then using those resources to develop Action Plans to use in specific
situations which are determined by you. WRAP® is adaptable to any situation. WRAP® also includes a
Crisis Plan or Advance Directive. WRAP® is universal ― it is for anyone, any time, and for any of
life’s challenges.
