      <p>Taking a screening test or “self-assessment” is one of the quickest and
        easiest ways to determine whether you are experiencing symptoms of a mental
        health condition. <span class="bold">Mental health conditions, such as
        depression or anxiety, are real, common and treatable. And recovery is
        possible.</span> The screening tests on this site are <span class="italics">
        completely anonymous and confidential.</span></p>

      <p>Following screening, you will be provided with information, resources and
        tools to discuss the results with a provider.</p>

      <p>Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, are serious conditions
        that affect not only your quality of life but your physical health. Did
        you know that having a mood disorder may increase your heart attack risk and
         decrease your ability to recover from other illnesses like stroke,
        diabetes, multiple sclerosis and cancer?</p>
