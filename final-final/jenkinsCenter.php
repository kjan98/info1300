<h1 class = "pageTitle">The Jenkins Center for Hope and Recovery</h1>

<p>The Jenkins Center for Hope and Recovery is a drop-in center for those who use or have used
mental health services.
</p>

<p>The Jenkins Center provides a safe environment where mental health consumers can relax,
have fun with peers, and share information and support. The center is unique because it is staffed
by peers, not healthcare professionals or government administrators.
</p>

<p>Peer run classes, groups, and activities such as women and menâ€™s groups, writing groups, arts
and crafts activities, as well as workshops and special events are publicized on a monthly calendar.
The center is comprised of an activity room, TV room, and several quiet rooms, as well as meeting
facilities.
</p>

<p>The Jenkins Center hosts a weekly Wednesday dinner, monthly birthday celebrations, and
occasional field trips. During business hours the center provides coffee, tea, juice or lemonade
and several days a week offers a variety of fresh fruit. We are open Tuesdays through Fridays
from 9am to 6pm and Saturdays from noon to 4. Stop by and see what we are all about.
