        <p class = "bio"> I have been at the Mental Health Association since
          2001. I am born and raised in Ithaca and a graduate of LACS. I received
           my BS in Human Services from Empire State College. I became the Executive
           Director in 2015 after serving as both the Assistant Director and the Wellness
            Services Program Director. I wish to live in a world where an individual
            who experiences a mental health issue is treated with dignity and respect.
            And like physical health, mental health is promoted and treatment is both
            preventative and accessible. It is important to me that our agency fulfill
            it’s mission of service to this community through education, advocacy and support.
            I currently live in Lodi and I am the single parent of a beautiful and brilliant
            daughter who is attending college in Rochester. </p>

             I grew up in Trumansburg, studied Cinema Production at Ithaca College,
             and although I enjoyed the few years I spent teaching English abroad,
             I couldn’t be happier to be back home. As MHA’s Community Educator I get
             to use my knowledge in the field of communications, my experience as a teacher,
             and my love for the people of Tompkins County to help make our community
             more supportive, compassionate, and understanding. My mission is to raise our
              awareness of issues in the field of mental health, to inform people about the
              resources available in our area, and to fight stigma through education.
              Anyone with a mind needs to think about their mental wellness… your mind, your health! </p>

            <p class = "bio"> Originally from Rochester, NY, I came to
               Ithaca to attend Ithaca College, and fell in love with the area.
               Upon graduating with my BA in 2013, I was delighted to join the
               Mental Health Association as a respite provider for the KIDS FIRST Summer Camp.
                I found a passion for the work and the agency’s mission of supporting our
                community and fighting the stigma around mental health.  After that summer,
                I continued on as a skill builder and respite provider for youth and co-director
                for KIDS FIRST before joining the administrative staff in the fall of 2016.
                I am a certified Mental Health First Aid instructor and graduate of the
                 University of Youth Power Peer Advocacy training program.  At MHATC,
                 I am driven to create spaces where youth can be themselves, find their voice,
                  support each other, and grow. </p>

             <p class = "bio">I believe there are two basic functions as Director of Peer Services.
               I see my task as helping to prepare individuals who have lived the life of a person with eccentric
               behaviors realize the power they have to change. Second, that Certified Peer Specialists provide
               effective services to nearly all individuals in need of advocacy, mentoring, or simply of being heard. I
               have lived in Ithaca for too many years, so I am aware of most of the aids to individuals
               concerned with mental health issues. I have two children, one of whom has Downs Syndrome. This
                young man has provoked my interest in working with folks who are unable to articulate their
                emotional needs vocally–of course most people have such difficulty. I have BS from Cornell
                University (College of Agriculture, as it was known back then) and a MSW from Marywood University.
                 Please call, write, e-mail to let me know how we can help one another. </p>
