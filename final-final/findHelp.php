<p>When you have concerns about your mental health, you want to get help. Fortunately, there are a
wide range of treatments and supports. We’re here to help.
</p>

<h3><a class = "links" href="typesOfProfessionals.php">Types of Professionals</a></h3>
<p>As you work on your recovery, providers can help you in many ways. They can help you to deal with
current stress, heal old traumas, make decisions about medication and develop treatment plans that reflect
your goals. Choosing a mental health provider can be challenging, but make sure you match your needs with
his or her experience and specialty to get the most out of your treatment.
</p>

<h3><a class = "links" href="typesOfTherapy.php">Types of Therapy</a></h3>
<p>There are many different types of therapy, including those that are most
  effective with families or groups of people. When considering a therapist,
   ask them if they use a particular type of therapy and how it works. You
  may get more out of therapy if you understand how the process usually
  works and how the therapist thinks it will help you. Some therapists will
  blend a few different approaches together to suit your particular needs.
</p>

<h3><a class = "links" href="selfAssessment.php">Self-Assessment</a></h3>
<p>Taking a screening test or “self-assessment” is one of the quickest and
  easiest ways to determine whether you are experiencing symptoms of a mental
  health condition. <span class="bold">Mental health conditions, such as
  depression or anxiety, are real, common and treatable. And recovery is
  possible.</span> The screening tests on this site are <span class="italics">
  completely anonymous and confidential.</span>

<h3><a class = "links" href="localSupportGroups.php">Local Support Groups</a></h3>
<p>A comprehensive list of support groups in the Tompkins County area.</p>
<p>Inclusion in these listings does not imply an endorsement by The Mental
  Health Association in Tompkins County, nor does omission signify
  disapproval; these listings are intended only for information purposes. It
  is recommended that you call before attending any group as they may
  require an attendance fee, have certain restrictions, or have changed
  location and time from what is listed.<p>
</p>

<h3 class = "subtitle">Ready to Make the Call?</h3>
<p>Spend a few minutes talking with him or her on the phone, ask about their approach to working with
patients, their philosophy, whether or not they have a specialty or concentration.
For example, some psychologists specialize in family counseling or child counseling, while others
specialize in divorce or coping with the loss of a loved one.
</p>

<h3 class = "subtitle">The First Meeting</h3>
<p>On your first visit, the counselor or the doctor will want to get to know you and why you called him
or her. The counselor will want to know–what you think the problem is, about your life, what you do,
where you live, with whom you live. It is also common to be asked about your family and friends.
This information helps the professional to assess your situation and develop a plan for treatment.
</p>

<h3 class = "subtitle">What Should I Do if I Don't Feel Comfortable with the Professional?</h3>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable after the first, or even several visits, talk about your feelings at your next
meeting; and don’t be afraid to contact another counselor. Feeling comfortable with the professional you
choose is very important to the success of your treatment!
