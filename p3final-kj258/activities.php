  <h1> Fun For All Ages </h1>
  <?php include 'includes/navigation.php';?>


  <p class = intro> Come and see what we have to offer! There's more than listed here, but we figured
    we'd leave some mysteries for you to discover at the festival. Most of the events happen
    across all three days, so if you can't make everything, don't worry! There's always tomorrow!
